Hey, I'm **Avanthika** 👋

I'm a **full-time learner** and a **cybersecurity master's student**.
I like exploring the deeper layers of code and security.

I’ve been in **web application security for 4 years**, starting off as a CTF player with:

- **[Team bi0s](https://bi0s.in/)** — India’s #1 CTF team 
- **[Team Shakti](https://www.shakticon.com/)** — India’s #1 women-only CTF team  

These teams shaped the way I think about problem-solving, exploitation, and security research.

These days, I’m taking learning slowly but deeply, exploring bugs, reading code, experimenting with ideas, and trying to understand things beyond the surface level.

Before starting this blog, I published a write-up here:

🔗 [Analysing CVE-2024-24942 leading to unauthenticated Path Traversal](https://blog.0daylabs.com/2024/12/11/jetbrains-teamcity-authbypass-path-traversal/)

Read my CTF notes here:

## **What I'm Into**

My interests revolve around:

- **Java source code analysis**  
- **CVE reproduction & reversing**  
- **CTFs & web exploitation**

## **Outside Security**

When I’m not breaking applications or reading source code, you'll find me:

- Reading fiction.(Find me on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186181641-avanthika-anand))
- Planning future trips in my head :)
