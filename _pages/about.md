Hey, I'm **Avanthika** 👋

I'm a **full-time learner** and a **cybersecurity master's student**.
I like exploring the deeper layers of code and security.

I’ve been in **web application security for 4 years**, starting off as a CTF player with:

- **[Team bi0s](https://bi0s.in/)** — India’s #1 CTF team 
- **[Team Shakti](https://www.shakticon.com/)** — India’s #1 women-only CTF team  

These teams shaped the way I think about problem-solving, exploitation, and security research.

These days, I’m taking learning slowly but deeply, exploring bugs, reading code, experimenting with ideas, and trying to understand things beyond the surface level.

## **What I'm Into**

My interests revolve around:

- **Java source code analysis**  
- **CVE reproduction & reversing**  
- **CTFs & web exploitation**

## **Outside Security**

When I’m not breaking applications or reading source code, you'll find me:

- Reading fiction.(Find me on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186181641-avanthika-anand))
- Planning future trips in my head :)
